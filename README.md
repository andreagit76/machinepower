# machinepower
Simple Linux CLI tool that shows:
Uptime of the Computer,
RAM usage
and medium CPU temperatures.
And Gpu temperatures
For the tool to function you will need:
python3 (yeah)

## Usage
1) First, Install The Debian Package, the raw file
in the KDE D.E, it should bring you to the KDE Store to install the deb. file
when its all installed, run on the terminal:

machinepower

To remove the tool, write: sudo apt remove machinepower

proggramm will be update in the future. Thanks
